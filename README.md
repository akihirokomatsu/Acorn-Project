# Acorn-Project
# The idea is the same as the master branch, except only python will be used (see below original readme)

Trying to find how much money Acorn would have made me last year

Source: Bank of America monthly credit card statements

Tools: python, Excel

Steps:

1) downloaded monthly Bank of America credit card statements of 2017
2) copied records of credit card transactions into .txt file called 'cc_transactions.txt'

--python portion

3) used python script (main.py) to parse records and grab only the Date and Amount
4) exported parsed records to a new .txt file called 'cc_transactions_parsed.txt'

-- Excel portion

5) opened 'cc_transactions_parsed.txt' in Excel, space delimited
6) created new columns - Purchase_Amt_Rounded, Amt_Invested, No_days_until_EOY, Compounded_Amt
    Purchase_Amt_Rounded: round each credit card transaction up
    Amt_Invested: the difference between Purchase_Amt_Rounded and the transaction amount
    No_days_until_EOY: number of days until the end of the year
    Compounded_Amt: value of Amt_Invested compounded based on SPY daily returns
7) calculated compounding returns with Acorn costs

Summary Findings:

Nominal Investment	              $145.53

Nominal Value of Investment EOY	  $160.73 

Compounding Acorn Fees	          $13.26

Actual Value of Investment	      $147.47 

Annual Return	                    1.33%  (YUCK!)

Conclusion: Acorn's $1 monthly fee ate into my annual return. I was better off putting my funds in an index fund on Robinhood (20%+ returns).
